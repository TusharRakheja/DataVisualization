#Data Visualization

This repository was constructed by merging two distinct repositories - one for each programming assignment of the course Data Visualization - a MOOC by UIUC on Coursera.

Even though it started out as an assignment, I hope to keep trying new things with these two datasets and their respective visualizations.

As of 19/10/15, this repository has 3 projects. Click on any one to find out more!
